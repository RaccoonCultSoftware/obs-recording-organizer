# Release Notes

## v1.3.0 - Real-Time Split Recording Support (2025-10-06)

### üéâ Major Features

#### Real-Time Split Recording Tracking
**Automatic tracking and organization of split recordings with zero configuration!**

- **Active monitoring** during recording (checks every 2 seconds)
- **Real-time detection** of new segments as OBS creates them
- **Automatic organization** of ALL segments when recording stops
- **Works with any split size** or time-based splitting

**Before:** Only the last segment was moved, earlier segments were left behind  
**After:** All segments from the entire recording session are moved together

**Example:**
```
Recording starts ‚Üí Script begins tracking
‚îú‚îÄ 11:50:20.mov created (50MB) ‚Üí Tracked
‚îú‚îÄ 11:51:28.mov created (50MB) ‚Üí Tracked  
‚îî‚îÄ 11:52:34.mov created (final) ‚Üí Tracked

Recording stops ‚Üí All 3 files moved to organized folder
```

### Technical Changes

- **ADDED:** Timer-based segment monitoring (`check_for_new_segments()`)
- **ADDED:** Event handling for `OBS_FRONTEND_EVENT_RECORDING_STARTING`
- **CHANGED:** Organization strategy from pattern matching to active tracking
- **IMPROVED:** Log output shows segment detection in real-time
- **FIXED:** Split recordings now properly move all segments together

### Log Output Example
```
